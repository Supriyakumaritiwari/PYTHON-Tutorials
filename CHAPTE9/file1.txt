The gentle hum of the early morning breeze stirred the leaves outside the window, casting dappled shadows on the wooden floor. Birds chirped softly in the distance, as the world slowly awakened from its slumber. A warm cup of tea sat on the table, steam curling upward like a whisper. It was a moment of quiet reflection, where time seemed to pause, allowing space for thoughts to wander freely, unburdened by the noise of the day.
